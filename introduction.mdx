## ðŸ”® What is Psychic
[Psychic](https://psychic.dev/) is an open source data integration platform for large language models (LLMs). 
Psychic includes full OAuth flows for 10+ data sources, transforms data from each source into vector store optimized Documents, and handles data syncs automatically.
Psychic is designed to work with applications that use [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/index.html), but can integrate with most other tech stacks.

There are 3 parts of the platform
* ðŸª„ **Psychic Link:** A modal that lets end users to connect their data sources with a point and click interface, using OAuth. Available as an NPM package for React projects, or as a magic link.
* ðŸª¢ **Universal API:** Abstractions to make it easy to ingest [Document](/api-reference/endpoint/get-documents) and [Conversation]((/api-reference/endpoint/get-conversations)) data from any connected source through a single API endpoint. Filter based on `connector_id` and `account_id`. New integrations can be added by implementing a new `DataConnector` in the server-side code.
* ðŸŽ© **Psychic Dashboard:** A front-end for the Psychic platform that makes it easy to manage connections and connect data sources without having to add Link to an existing app.

The easiest way to get started is with our [quickstart tutorial](/quickstart).
