## ðŸª¢ Psychic Link
Psychic Link is a React SDK to help your users connect their accounts to Psychic through a simple UI. 
You can add Link to your React project in 4 lines of code, or generate a magic URL that can be shared with the right people at your customer's company.

### 1. Install Psychic Link
```bash
npm install @psychic-api/link
```

### 2. Import it into your project
```javascript
import { usePsychicLink } from '@psychic-api/link'
```

### 3. Configure Psychic Link with your API key and a callback function
Unpack the functions and state variables.
```javascript
const { open, isReady, isLoading, error } = usePsychicLink(publicKey, psychicCallback) 
```
* `open` is a function that opens the Psychic Link modal to prompt your user to connect their account
* `isReady` is a boolean that indicates whether Psychic Link is initialized and ready to be shown
* `isLoading` is a boolean that indicates whether your application is still waiting for a connection. `isLoading` will be `true` as long as no window event has been received from the Psychic Link modal indicating the connection was successful.
* `error` is null, or a string describing why Psychic Link failed to establish a connection. If `error` is not null, it means something has gone wrong and you should handle the error.
* `publicKey` should be your public API key from Psychic, which you can get from the [Psychic dashboard](https://dashboard.psychic.dev).
* `psychicCallback` is a callback function that will be called once a connection is successfully established.

### 5. Set an Account ID
The Account ID should be unique for every user. We recommend mapping Account ID to the unique user ID from your application. Documents and Conversations in Psychic are queried through a combination of Account IDs and Connector IDs.

```javascript
const accountId = `user12345`
```

### 6. Trigger the modal
Call `open` (or whatever variable that you unpacked it into) with the Account ID to open the Psychic Link modal as a new window and initiate the connection flow. You can decide when and how to trigger this flow from your application.
```javascript
<button onClick={() => {
    open(accountId)
  }} >
  Connect to Notion
</button>
```

### 6. Handle success or errors
If the connection is successful, you can implement the handling logic from the callback provided to `usePsychicLink`. Typically, you'll want to show the user a message saying the connection was sucessful, and send a request to your server to [fetch the Documents]('/pulling-data') from this new connection.

For example:
```javascript
const psychicCallback = (newConnection) => {
  setNewConnection(newConnection)
  setSuccessMessage(`Successfully created connection between account ${newConnection.accountId} and ${newConnection.connectorId}`)
  fetchDocumentsFromServer(newConnection.accountId, newConnection.connectorId)
}
```

### 7. Fetch documents
After your users have connected with Psychic, you can fetch the documents they've shared by making an API call from your server. See [Pulling Data](('/querying')) for instructions
