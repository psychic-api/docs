The `connector_id` for Notion is `gdrive`.

## Authorization Type
Psychic uses Google's [OAuth 2.0 implementation](https://developers.google.com/identity/openid-connect/openid-connect) to connect to Google Drive.

## Authorization Flow
After your users authorize their Google account, they will be able to pick the specific files they want to share in the Google Drive picker.
